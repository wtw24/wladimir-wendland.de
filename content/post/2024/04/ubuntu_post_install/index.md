There's a unique satisfaction that comes with a fresh operating system install. Ubuntu 24.04 LTS boots up clean, fast, and full of potential. But a stock installation is just the starting pointâ€”a blank canvas. To transform it from a generic desktop into a personalized powerhouse tailored for development, productivity, and comfort, a series of deliberate steps are required. This is the process of making the system truly yours, equipping it with the right tools, tweaking the settings for a perfect workflow, and shaping the user interface to feel like home.

Over the years, I've refined a personal checklist that I run through after every new Ubuntu installation. It's a comprehensive guide that has evolved from a simple list of commands into a battle-tested script for creating my ideal work environment. In this post, I'm sharing that entire cheat sheet with you. We will cover everything from essential system updates and must-have software to powerful terminal customizations with Oh My Zsh, essential GNOME extensions for a streamlined desktop experience, and a robust setup for developers including Docker and Kubernetes tools. Whether you're a newcomer to Ubuntu or a seasoned user looking for new ideas, consider this your roadmap to a perfectly configured system.

ibus-setup
~~~
- Go to the `Emoji` tab.
- Find the `Unicode code point:` entry and click the three dots (...) to edit its shortcut.
- In the dialog, click `Delete` to remove the keybinding, then `OK`.
- Close the IBus Preferences window. The change takes effect immediately.
